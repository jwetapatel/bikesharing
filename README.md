# NYC Citibike Analysis

# Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the current analysis is to prepare visualizations that give potential investors a look into the highly-successful NYC Citibike bike-sharing program, so that they can see for themselves that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Among others, we have prepared visualizations that,

1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,

2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
